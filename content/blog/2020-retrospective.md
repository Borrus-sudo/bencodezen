Let's start with the obvious: 2020 did not go exactly as planned for anyone. When I look back at my [2019 Retrospective](https://www.bencodezen.io/blog/2019-retrospective), it's funny looking at what I thought 2020 would be like, and what it ended up being instead.

## Making the Best of 2020

2020 started off with an exciting milestone for me as I joined the Vue.js core team and started a brand new Vue.js podcast: [Enjoy the Vue](https://www.enjoythevue.io). And then to top it off, I got to attend VueConfUS in person and had an incredible time teaching a workshop and emceeing the conference with my amazing co-host [Maria Lamardo](https://twitter.com/MariaLamardo).

And though it started off well, the reality is that whatever plan I had for the rest of year was out of the window. With all plans disrupted by the pandemic, like everyone else, I made the best I could out of the situation.

Without going too much into the details, here are some of the key obstacles that 2020 presented for me:

- Being separated from friends and family which impacted my mental health like many others
- Attempting to be productive but failing time and time again
- Feeling guilty for not being as productive as I thought I should be
- Many hours spent trying new things and making lots mistakes and finding dead ends

Since all my time was spent indoors and away from the public, it's been a lot of trial and error. **A lot** of trial and error. Here are just some of the things I've tried:

- Yoga
- Knitting
- Communication Workshop
- Podcast
- Voice Coach
- Brand Strategist
- Ukulele Lessons
- Part Time YouTube Academy
- Second-Brain / Zettelkasten
- Productivity Systems
- Peloton

And I haven't even listed all the random tech, gear and gizmos I purchased trying to keep my sanity in the midst of the year.

To be fair though, it hasn't been a gigantic downhill since this all started. In addition to having the chance to work with the incredible teams at [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/) and [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/), one of the biggest highlights from this year was having the opportunity to join Netlify's DX team and help with the launch of [Jamstack Explorers](https://explorers.netlify.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=explorers-bh&utm_campaign=devex), a free video learning platform, in addition to publishing my own [Composition API course](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/launching-with-composition-api?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=mission-lca-bh&utm_campaign=devex) on there as well.

## Next Steps

Unlike last year, I won't try and make any big proclamations about what 2021 will be like. I just know that I will keep trying to make the best of each day and try to live it according to a set of principles and values I can be proud of. And if I can end the day each ["good tired"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbpoUWO3kA8), then that will be enough for me.

With all that said, while it's certainly been a challenging year, I am incredibly grateful to everyone who made helped make the best out of it. Here's to 2021 and finding a way forward, one day at a time.
