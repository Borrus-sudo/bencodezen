        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Components are the bread and butter of modern front-end frameworks.
          They help you structure and manage your application by gluing together
          your application logic and the interface. However, as an application
          scales and teams get larger, components often get bigger and difficult
          to manage.

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <h3>What if I need to cancel?</h3>
      <p>
        Get a full 100% refund up to 5 days prior to the course. No questions
        asked. All other cancellations will be considered on a case-by-case
        basis.
      </p>
      <h3>How is this different from the conference workshop?</h3>
      <p>
        This workshop is designed to maximize student and instructor time to
        ensure the time is more personalized to the class. In addition, a full
        day workshop (estimated 8 hours) can be a lot of information to take in
        at once. By providing a half day workshop, this allows more flexibility
        for attendees to request for time off and get support from their
        companies.
      </p>
      <h3>Could I request my company to pay for the workshop?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely! You will still be getting the same caliber of instruction
        and material as you would from a conference. The only thing that makes
        it even better is your company doesn't need to pay for travel or
        extensive time off!
      </p>
