# Blog Posts

::: tip Quick Disclosure
Everything here is written via the stream of consciousness writing technique and should be treated as a rough draft at best (i.e., very little editing). However, I promise you one thing:  **none of the posts below are meant to be offensive or malicious in any way**. So if you read something that you feel is offensive, please let me know and I'll be happy to take the time to rewrite it!
