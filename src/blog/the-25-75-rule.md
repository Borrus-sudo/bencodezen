I recently came across an article written by Jared Spool called "Good, Bads, and Dailies: Lessons for Conducting Great Critiques" which covers the concepts of what makes reviews / critiques good or bad. One thing that stuck out to me in particular was his discussion around Pixar's use of a meeting called "Dailies" and the 25-75 rule that governed the dailies.

## The 80/20 Rule (i.e., the Pareto Principle)

When some of you read the title, I'm hoping that it rang off the familiarity of the Pareto principle. For those who have never heard of it before, the 80/20 rule simply states that:

> 80% of the effects often come from 20% of the causes

So as far as a couple examples of how it might apply:

- In sales lead generation, 80% of revenue often comes from 20% of clients
- In a stock portfolio, 80% of profits will come from approximately 20% of your porfolio
- In software engineering, 80% of related errors and crashes come from 20% of the most reported bug

## The 25/75 Rule

According to Jared's article, when people are presenting their work at the Dailies, there is a rule:

> The presented work should be at least 25% done and no more than 75% completed.

In other words, it should always be a work in progress (WIP). And the reason for this is quite straightforward.

1. If the work is less than 25% complete, it is too early to properly evaluate or review. After all, it is not worth people's time to look into since you haven't spent the time yourself to even vet the concept past the thought experiment phase.
1. If the work is past 75% complete, there has often been so much resource invested into it that it is often difficult for the work to take criticism and/or feedback. After all, can you imagine being told to start over if you're 95% of the way there?

::: warning Note
I haven't been able to do the research to verify the fact that Pixar used or continues to use this technique in their meetings, but at this time, I'm not terribly worried about it since I think the principle is valid regardless.

## Living and Breathing the 25/75 Rule

As I wrote a while back in my Progress Over Perfection post, I have been trying my best to treat the blog as a place of brainstorming and trying out new concepts without trying to spend time polishing the content to the extreme. And in lieu of that, all of my blog posts lately have been the result of taking an idea and trying to push it into this 25/75 range. In other words, I spend no more than an hour on these sometimes before publishing it. And while this is terrifying on multiple levels to me, I always remind myself that I can update it as needed.
