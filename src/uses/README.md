# Uses

There are times where people ask me about what software or gear I am using. This page will serve as a living document for people to always know the latest and greatest.

This page is inspired from Wes Bos' [Uses](https://wesbos.com/uses/) page.

## Editor & Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my code editor of choice. I was a die-hard [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/) fan before and even bought a license with my own money. So suffice to say I went kicking and screaming over to VS Code, but honestly I can't imagine going back.
    - [Cobalt2 Workspace Theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) has been my theme of choice for a few years now. I try to switch to new ones from time to time, but this one has been a staple for me because of how many scenarios it accounts for.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is my terminal of choice for now, but I have been eyeing [hyper](https://hyper.is/) for some time as well.
    - [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with [powerlevel9k theme](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k) is what I use instead of bash since the overall experience is more enjoyable for me in the terminal and makes everything visually pleasing to look at
- [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/) is my font of choice. And yes, I was crazy enough to pay $200 for it. My basic rationale was that this is something that I will be staring at for hours on end and why  

## Desktop Apps

- [Notion.so](https://www.notion.so/) is my note taking app of choice and will probably continue to be so for a long time.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is my Spotlight replacement on MacOS and I love it for all the cool things you can do with it. 
- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) is an incredible tool for creating your own custom macros so you can get even faster with your keyboard. Combining this with [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) allows me to create an array of scoped shortcuts with the hyper key (Cmd + Alt + Ctrl + Shift simultaneously)
- [Fantastical 2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) is my calendar tool of choice since it has an incredible natural language parsing ability which allows me to very easily add new events. Also, it's very visually pleasing to look at when managing multiple calendars.
