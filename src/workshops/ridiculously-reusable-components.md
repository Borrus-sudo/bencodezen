## About

Components are the bread and butter of modern front-end frameworks. They help you structure and manage your application by gluing together your application logic and the interface. However, as an application scales and teams get larger, components often get bigger and difficult to manage.

Throughout the workshop, weâ€™ll build a set of components for a preexisting application. Following the evolving requirements, we will perform a series of refactoring cycles to explore different possible solutions and patterns/anti-patterns.

## What You'll Learn

- Best practices and techniques for designing components that are more resilient as your application and team grows and scales

- Component design patterns that give you more options to solve common problems found in applications

- Tips and tricks to make you more efficient in your development workflow

## Recommended Prerequisites

- Intermediate HTML
- Intermediate CSS
- Intermediate JavaScript
- Familiarity with Vue.js

_Intermediate means that you know the basics of the language and understand the fundamentals behind how it works._

## FAQs

### How can I learn more about the course?

Ben will be holding a webinar to give an overview of the course and answer any questions on March 22nd at 7 PM ET. You can sign up here.

### What if I need to cancel?

Get a full 100% refund up to 5 days prior to the course. No questions asked. All other cancellations will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### How is this different from the conference workshop?

This workshop is designed to maximize student and instructor time to ensure the time is more personalized to the class. In addition, a full day workshop (estimated 8 hours) can be a lot of information to take in at once. By providing a half day workshop, this allows more flexibility for attendees to request for time off and get support from their companies.

### Could I request my company to pay for the workshop?

Absolutely! You will still be getting the same caliber of instruction and material as you would from a conference. The only thing that makes it even better is your company doesn't need to pay for travel or extensive time off!

### What if I want to attend the course, but the times listed don't work for me?
